Hi. I'm Ili Rabihah Razali, a professional technologist who currently have a passion on data analytics and machine learning.  I have enrolled in prost graduate program
for data science and business analytics to pursue my interest.  Eventually, I have been exposed to a new knowledge of data and AI.  I have been dealing with structured
and semi structured data for more than a decade now, and currently love to explore unstructured data.  As I am developing such interest in this field, I am hoping to get an opportunity to explore this new career transition of mine.

All my data analytics and machine learning project has been uploaded on my github.
